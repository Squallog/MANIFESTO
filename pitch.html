                The short documentary will explore the various forms of companionship provided by dogs.
                It will begin as a montage, presenting various people going about their lives with their
                companions, but will slowly build towards the core moment which will be uncovered at the end.

                The moment in question will be an inception - either the birth of a new litter, or the adoption
                of a dog by a new family. In concluding with actuality drawn from a moment of inception, the
                peice will gain a cyclical structure - reflecting the historic link between mankind and its
                affinity for dogs.
