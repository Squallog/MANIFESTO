                The Pitch
            </h2>
            <p>
                The short documentary will explore the various forms of companionship provided by dogs.
                It will begin as a montage, presenting various people going about their lives with their
                companions, but will slowly build towards the core moment which will be uncovered at the end.
            </p>
            <p>
                The moment in question will be an inception - either the birth of a new litter, or the adoption
                of a dog by a new family. In concluding with actuality drawn from a moment of inception, the
                peice will gain a cyclical structure - reflecting the historic link between mankind and its
                affinity for dogs.
            </p>
            <h2>
                The Challenge
            </h2>
            <p>
                We considered this idea initially, but decided to shelve it due
                to logistical complexity surrounding the key moment of actuality.
                There are major challenges associated with attempting to film a 
                whelping process - strangers with film equipment can easily
                spook or stress out a whelping dog, and with the whelping process 
                being so unpredictable, we'd need to have a camera available and ready to 
                get on-location 24/7 during the leadup to the shot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Addressing these challenges, we could instead shoot the introduction of a 
                dog in a shelter to a new home - this could lend itself to themes tackling 
                the tendancy for people and their dogs to lead each other through moments 
                of crisis - however there is still the challenge of having to find a shelter
                with an adoption taking place during the production perod.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What's Changed?
            </h2>
            <p>
                At the time of the discussion in which we chose to shelve this idea, we had 
                been given a grade of 65% for our film-jam work. This left minimal room for 
                for risk and nessecitated the development of a safe, reliable idea that 
                could be executed with few logistical challenges. Under this framework, it 
                was decided that the story of Darryl Kennedy was most appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the day prior to the presentation pitch, however, the revised grades were 
                released - we had been pushed up to 75%. At 75% there is considerable wiggle 
                room to compensate for setbacks in subsequent assignments. To this end, the 
                criterion that led us to settle on Daryrl's story are no longer relevant.
            </p>
            <h2>The Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                I've sent out feeler emails and forum posts to dog shelters and breeder groups 
                with the aim of finding a breeder or shelter who would be happy to colaborate 
                with the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other footage featured throughout the doc will focus on people from all manner 
                of backgrounds going about their day-to-day lives in the companionship of their 
                dogs. These shots will take an observational inspired form, with minimal dialogue 
                or direct interaction with contributors - these shots will be designed to 
                higlight the often overlooked but ever-present signifficance of dogs in our society.
