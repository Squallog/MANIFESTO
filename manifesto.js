                    Darryl Kenedy has a great story - it is relatable, motivational, and human - but the man has built a career around telling it.
                    There is little scope for a story that is <em>new</em>.
                    A peice covering his story will only ever be <em>fine</em>.

                    Our <em>film-jam</em> submission was fine. But after resubmission
                    was pushed up to 75%. Lets not waste our own potential again.
